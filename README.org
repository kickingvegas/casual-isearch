* Casual I-Search - A Transient menu for I-Search

This package contains a [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]] menu for I-Search. When in basic I-Search mode, this menu can be raised by pressing the ~C-o~ key. A menu of different isearch commands will be offered as shown below:

[[file:docs/images/casual-isearch-tmenu.png]]

* Requirements
Casual I-Search requires usage of
- Emacs ≥ 29.1
- Casual Lib ≥ 1.1.0

* Install
Use the following lines to install casual-isearch-tmenu.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical yes
  (require 'casual-isearch)
  (keymap-set isearch-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-isearch-tmenu)
#+end_src

Alternately install with ~use-package~ using the following initialization:
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package casual-isearch
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map isearch-mode-map ("C-o" . casual-isearch-tmenu)))
#+end_src

The keybinding to ~casual-isearch-tmenu~ can be changed to user preference.

** A Note on Package Dependencies
Casual I-Search requires Casual Lib which in turn requires a recent installation of Transient 0.6.0+ from either [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/transient.html][ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/transient][MELPA]]. As an older version of Transient is built-in to the Emacs release, the package manager ~package.el~ will /not/ update this package unless the customizable variable ~package-install-upgrade-built-in~ is set to ~t~. Set this variable and proceed with installing Casual I-Search. Alternately invoking ~package-install~ with a prefix (~C-u~) will temporarily coerce the update of the built-in package. (example: ~C-u M-x package-install~ ~casual-avy~)

As Transient is closely tied to Magit, installing the latest version of Magit (via [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/magit.html][non-GNU ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/magit][MELPA]]) before installing Casual I-Search can also pick up the latest version of Transient.


* Menu Commands
The following I-Search commands are grouped as follows in the Transient menu ~casual-isearch-tmenu~. Keys associated with each command are shown enclosed in parentheses.

** Edit Search String
- ~isearch-edit-string~ (~e~)
- ~isearch-yank-word-or-char~ (~w~)
- ~isearch-yank-symbol-or-char~ (~s~)
- ~isearch-yank-line~ (~l~)
- ~isearch-yank-kill~ (~y~)

- ~isearch-query-replace-regexp~ (~x~)
** Toggle
- ~isearch-toggle-regexp~ (~X~)
- ~isearch-toggle-symbol~ (~S~)
- ~isearch-toggle-word~ (~W~)
- ~isearch-toggle-case-fold~ (~F~)
- ~isearch-toggle-lax-whitespace~ (~L~)

- ~isearch-highlight-regexp~ (~h~)

**  Dismiss
The Transient key ~C-q~ will dismiss the menu.

* Usage
When in search mode (typically via the keybinding ~C-s~ or ~C-r~), pressing the keybinding ~C-o~ (or binding of your preference) will raise the Transient menu ~casual-isearch-tmenu~. Once raised, only the /I-Search/ commands in the *Replace* and *Misc* sections will automatically dismiss the menu when selected. All other /I-Search/ commands will /not/ dismiss the menu.

Note that editing the search text via ~isearch-edit-string~ will enter a recursive editing mode that is normally exited when pressing the return key.

Use ~C-g~ to dismiss this Transient menu.
